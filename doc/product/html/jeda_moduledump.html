<h1>
Appendix D. Observing Jeda Execution from Verilog Dump</h1>

<blockquote>While debugging Verilog code with a wave form software, it
is handy to know what's going on in Jeda code on Verilog Dump. In Jeda
Module, there's some information that the user can observe to correlate
the Verilog activity with Jeda execution. If the activity of Jeda Module
is recorded in the dump file, the user can observe those Jeda execution
information.
<br>Note that D.4 Global Variable, and D.5 Static Variable transition can
only be observed when the code is compiled with -g (debug) option.</blockquote>

<h2>
D.1 CLOCK and CycleCount</h2>

<blockquote>Jeda's internal cycle is based on CLOCK signal on the Jeda
Module. The user can drive it from Jeda code (using drive_clock() member
function), or drive it from outside. The positive edge of the CLOCK signal
is used to count the timeout.
<br>Various message from Jeda and Jeda Debugger includes the cycle information
as the result of counting posedge of CLOCK. This counting is done in the
Jeda Module, on a reg CycleCount:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reg [31:0] CycleCount ;
<p>The user can always use this number in the message by calling get_cycle()
function as:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf( "Drive data to %h at cycle %d\n", data, get_cycle()
) ;
<p>This is handy number (rather than simulation time) to know where you
are, and correlate the Jeda activity to the Verilog execution.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h2>
D.2&nbsp; Jeda Output Port</h2>

<blockquote>When the user declares an output or inout port, the output value
from the jeda code will be stored in a reg with name jeda_out_&lt;port>,
or jeda_out_&lt;portset>_&lt;port>. For example, if you have a port 'output
[7:0] OUTB' , you'll find the reg declaration:
<blockquote>reg [7:0] jeda_out_OUTB ;</blockquote>
By observing such jeda_out_&lt;name> regs, you can observe which value
is driven by Jeda code.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h2>
D.3&nbsp; Jeda Input Port</h2>

<blockquote>When the user declares an input or inout port, the input value
to the jeda code is on a wire with name jeda_in_&lt;port>, or jeda_in_&lt;portset>_&lt;port>.
For example, if you have a port 'input [7:0] INB' , you'll find the wire
declaration:
<blockquote>wire vectored [7:0] jeda_in_INB ;</blockquote>
By observing such jeda_in_&lt;name> wires, you can observe which value
is used as the input by Jeda code.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h2>
D.4 Global Variable</h2>

<blockquote>A global variable with int or bit type (non-array) has a shadow
variable in Jeda Module with the name var_&lt;name>. For example, a global
variable
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int x ;
<p>will have a shadow variable
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; integer var_x ;
<p>in Jeda Module, and the activity of the variable can be observed in
the dump file.
<br>Note that the value write back will only be done when Jeda code is
compiled and linked with -g option.</blockquote>

<h2>
D.4 Static Variable</h2>

<blockquote>A static variable declared in a function, a class, a member
function has a shadow variable in Jeda Module with the name svar_&lt;class>_&lt;func>_&lt;var>,
where &lt;class> is the class name (or empty if not in a class), &lt;func>
is the function name (or empty if not in a function), and &lt;var> is the
variable name. For example, a static var in a function:
<p>&nbsp; void foo() {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static bit [7:0] bbb ;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..
<br>&nbsp; }
<p>will have a shadow variable
<p>&nbsp; reg [7:0] svar__foo_bbb ;
<p>in Jeda Module and the activity of the static variable can be observed
in the dump file.
<br>Note that the value write back will only be done when Jeda code is
compiled and linked with -g option.</blockquote>
