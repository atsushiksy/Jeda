<b>1. Introduction</b></h1>

<blockquote>Jeda is a concurrent programming language designed for modeling
and verifying electronics chip/system designs.&nbsp; The language provides
and not limited to:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
flexible and dynamic concurrent programming mechanism with time/cycle concept</li>

<li>
object oriented programming</li>

<li>
various system classes such as <i>semaphore </i>and <i>events</i> to construct
dynamic concurrent systems efficiently.</li>

<li>
aspect oriented programming</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
The language syntax is based on C and Verilog also borrowing some ideas
from C++, Java and Perl.&nbsp; A Jeda program consists of various functions,
and it starts the execution from the function "main".&nbsp; Here's an example
of a simple Jeda code. (I'm not kidding..)
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp; void main() {</font>
<br><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf( "Hello
world!\n" ) ;</font>
<br><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp; }</font>
<p>The basic data elements that the language supports are:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- integer
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- Verilog style multi-value (can hold x &amp; z state) bit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It can be vectored as bit [5:0].
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- String
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; float&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- Single precision floating variable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Double precision
floating variable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Store
the pointer to the port (interface to Verilog)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The user defined data type can be declared as 'class'.
<p>Various array forms are supported over the data element above. The following
example provides declaration of all the array forms supported in Jeda for
type int.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp; foo[5] ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// Array
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp; moo[5][4][2]&nbsp; // Multidimensional
array
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp; bar[] ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// Associative array
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp; boo[*] ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// string indexed array
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp; bee&lt;> ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// list
<p>Jeda provides safeguards to minimize user programming errors. For instance,
the Jeda compiler&nbsp; employs strict type checks.&nbsp; In languages
line C and C++, pointers, cast assign are usually the areas programming
errors occur, thus Jeda does not support them. It&nbsp; checks the data
consistency at runtime (unless optimized) to detect the programming errors
that cannot be detected&nbsp; during compile time.
<p>Jeda implements an automatic garbage collection system.&nbsp; Due to
availability of this functionality, the user can now create and forget
the variable elements without worrying about the memory leak(as similarly
found in Java).&nbsp; The lack of the similar garbage collection mechanism
makes many languages unsuitable for describing complex logic behavior as
they&nbsp; require lots of programming effort&nbsp; to keep track&nbsp;
of memory usage(to avoid memory leaks that could hamper long simulation
runs). This added burden also&nbsp; affects the one's productivity as time
is wasted&nbsp; instead of writing system models or verification code.
<p>Jeda is a "compiled" language in the sense that a user's code is compiled
into a binary form at the execution time. The Jeda compiler (jedacmp) compiles
the Jeda code into intermediate object file. Jeda liner (jedalnk) links
multiple object files and create a C code. This C code is compiled and
linked with Jeda runtime library to a dynamic library form (.dl) as the
compiled execution image.
<p>Jeda runs with Verilog as a PLI code and accesses the Verilog signals
via a module (Jeda module). This module contains the ports the user specified
in Jeda code and drive/sample can be&nbsp; done through these ports. The
user create an instance of this Jeda module in the Verilog environment
and run Verilog with the Jeda PLI code.
<p>Jeda PLI code consists of two parts, static part and dynamic part. The
static part is a common code that is statically linked with Verilog (or
compiled with VCS). The dynamic part is produced as the result of Jeda
code compile &amp; link process as mentioned above, and dynamically loaded
to Verilog at execution time. So, as far as the port signals are identical,
the user can use the compiled Verilog execution image as is, and run different
test cases by just specifying the dynamic library with the plus argument
( +jeda_code=&lt;lib_name> ) .
