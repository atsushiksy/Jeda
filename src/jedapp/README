Here are the steps for building vzpp from gcc-2.95.2.  
The patch program called in patch_cpp is assumed to be GNU version.
The patch_cpp set the patch to be "/volume/dist/gnu/bin/patch".
This must be modified to a proper path to get GNU patch.

GNU makefile invokes the following process to create jedapp code.
Note that this process generates entire gcc code, and takes a long time. 

Before the gmake process, you need to obtain gcc-2.95.2.tar.gz from somewhere.


1. Expand the gcc package, which creates a directory gcc-2.95.2:
   gzip -dc gcc-2.95.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -

2. Patch cpp code:
   ./patch_cpp 

3. Make an object directory for building gcc and go there:
   mkdir build_gcc
   cd build_gcc

4. Configure gcc, don't build other languages:
   ../gcc-2.95.2/configure --enable-cpp --enable-languages=c++
   ( For a list of available configure options, please refer to
     gcc-2.95.2/install/CONFIGURE. )

5. Build gcc:
   gmake bootstrap-lean
   ( Adding lean to the bootstrap target will clean up those stage1 and stage2
     files after building gcc. )
