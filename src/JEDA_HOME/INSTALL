1. Before you Start
-------------------

    In order to run Jeda-X Verification System, following tools are
    required on your system:
        * gcc
        * perl5
        * tcl/tk, wish (needed to run debug window)

The section "Obtaining and installing packages" below gives
instructions where to find the binaries.

2. Extracting Binary files
--------------------------
Perform following steps:

  1. Contact support@jedatechnologies.com for information and access to
     to obtain the binary release file
	  jeda-X.<version_revision>.tar.gz

  2. Unpack the binary
	  gzip -cd jeda-X.<version_revision>.tar.gz | tar xvpf -

	  alternatively

	  tar xvfz jeda-X.<version_revision>.tar.gz

      You'll get the install directory 'Jeda-X.<version_revision>', and
      all the necessary files are expanded under the directory. We call
      this directory as <install_dir> in this document.

  3. Installing the binary
	  cd <install_dir>
	  run "./configure"

      The installation of Jeda part is done. Now, you need to set the
      environment properly and construct PLI environment for your Verilog
      simulator.

  4.  Setting User Environment

      You need to set $JEDA_HOME to <install_dir> directory.
      For the C shell environment, type:
	  setenv JEDA_HOME <install_dir>

      For the Korn and Bourne shells:
	  JEDA_HOME=<install_dir>
	  export JEDA_HOME

      Also, you need to add <install_dir>/bin to your command path and
      paths to the license manager daemon:
	  PATH=$PATH":<install_dir>/bin:<install_dir/license/bin"

2.  Starting Flexlm License Manager
----------------------------------------
Perform the following steps:

    1. Please contact Support@JedaTechnologies.com to Obtain the
       license file (most likely "jeda_x.lic")

    2. Copy <jeda_x.lic> to <install_dir>/license directory.

    3. Set the directory to LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable.
       Cshell:
        setenv LM_LICENCE_FILE <install_dir>/license/jeda_x.lic

       Korn & Bourne shells:
        LM_LICENCE_FILE=$LMLICENSE_FILE:<install_dir>/license/jeda_x.lic
        export LM_LICENSE_FILE

    4. If you are already running the Flexlm license server, you need to
       run 'lmrelead' to update to the new license environment.

       If you are not running the Flexlm license server, you need to run
       'lmgrd' on your server machine. Normally, this is done at the
       machine boot time. 
	cd <install_dir/license
	lmgrd -c jeda_x.lic

       For more detailed information about how to start the license server 
       please refer to Flexlm manual using your favorite browser:
       The file is:
       <install_dir>/license/doc/flexuser/chap6.htm 
      


3. testing your installation
----------------------------
This package provides a stand_alone Jeda test that you are advised to
run to check if the Jeda-X installation is correct. To do so please
perform the following:

cd <install_dir>/examples/verilog/bus_snooper/standalone_run
make
./run multi_transaction_random


----------------------------------------
Obtaining and installing packages
----------------------------------------

The following source trees can be downloaded for free from the
following locations. This is a 
        * gcc
        * perl5
        * wish (tcl/tk)

This section is "only" provides simple instructions to download and
install the necessary tools to run the Jeda-X Verification system. YOU
WILL HAVE TO CONSULT THE INSTALLATION GUIDES THAT ARE PROVIDED WITH
THE TOOLS.

Tcl/Tk
Obtain the source from
	http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.4.html

	Both packages have to be installed and tested separately

Perl
Both source and binary distributions for Perl are available at 
	http://www.perl.com/

gcc
GCC is the GNU compiler collection. Sources can be found at
	http://gcc.gnu.org


----------------------------------------
Trouble shooting
----------------------------------------
1. Installation "./configure" warnings for wish

   Mostly this is due to the following
   1. Not installing the "wish" binary. Please refer to the section
      "Obtaining and installing packages"

   2. The location of the "wish" executable has not been added to your
      PATH
