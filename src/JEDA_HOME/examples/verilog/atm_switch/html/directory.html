<p><font size=+1>4. Directory Structure and Makefile</font>
<ul>The following directories are used in this example. (In fact, this
is the structure I always use for my real verification work.):
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
verilog</li>

<br>This directory contains the verilog files.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
include</li>

<br>This directory contains include files (not derived from the source
files)
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
utils</li>

<br>This directory contains low level drivers and primitives. This directory
may also include the header files that is created from the source (with
-h option).
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
suites</li>

<br>This directory contains the top level with main() function which does
the initialization of the testbench. This directory may contains multiple
top levels that do the initialization differently.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
tests</li>

<br>This directory contains various test cases. The entry of the test cases
have the same name (squat_test() in this example) and called from main().
The final execution images (.dl files) for various tests are created in
this directory.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
run</li>

<br>This directory contains the Makefile that compiles the Jeda files.
It is also used to run simulation.</ul>

<p><br><a href="../run/Makefile">Makefile</a> under run directory is a
sort of general purpose makefile that works as far as the directory structure
is kept as above. (Note that you need GNU make for this.)
<br>The Jeda files are identified with .j suffix and automatically compiled
and linked. Adding a new test file is done by just create a new test file
(&lt;name>.j) under 'tests' directory. So as util files. Files under include
directory are assumed to be used for all the files.
<br>The files under utils are categorized by the name, as &lt;name>_0.j,
&lt;name>_1.j, &lt;name>_2.j. This numbers at the end represent the level
of reference, files with _0 won't referee any other util files, files with
_1 will referee _1 files, and files with _2 will referee _0 and _1 files.
The header files for the utils are automatically created by Jeda compiler.
<br>The drawbacks of using this generic Makefile are:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
You can't have a partially coded file (or junk) as &lt;name>.j. It ends
as make error.</li>

<li>
It always compile/link all the tests. When you are working on one specific
test, it's better to specify the specific image to make (make ../tests/&lt;name>.dl)
to avoid this happens.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>Having a unified directory structure through out the projects makes
things easy when you have to poke into someone's work. You always find
drivers and low level stuff under utils, test cases under tests.</ul>
