<p><font size=+1>1. Verilog Model and Specification</font>
<blockquote>The DUT (device under test) we use here is a 4 port ATM switch.
The original model is developed by Qualis Design Corporation, and downloaded
from Janick Bergeron's Verification Guild Project. <a href="http://www.janick.bergeron.com/guild/project.html">(http://www.janick.bergeron.com/guild/project.html)</a>
<p>The specification of the design is given by Qualis as <a href="../verilog/spec.pdf">spec.pdf</a>.
<p>The verilog model consists of 3 files:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../verilog/utopia1_atm_rx.v">utopia1_atm_rx.v</a></li>

<br>UTOPIA receiver module.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="../verilog/utopia1_atm_tx.v">utopia1_atm_tx.v</a></li>

<br>UTOPIA transmitter module.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="../verilog/squat.v">squat.v</a></li>

<br>4 port ATM switch model.</ul>

<p><br>By briefly observing the source code, I noticed the following problems:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Lookup happens on Zero VPI</li>

<br>The spec. (2.2.4) says:
<ul>For each non-errored cells received with a non-zero VPI, the configuration
information for that cells' VPI is looked up.</ul>
But the model does not check if VPI is zero and always do the lookup. Software
can put 0 on the entry 0 of the config register to accomplish this, but
at least the model does not follow what the spec. says.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Unfair transmit arbitration</li>

<br>The cell transfer mechanism in squat.v does not implement the fairness
among the port. The lower port always has the higher priority. The Thus,
it is very easy to create the starving situation.
<p>I will provide the test case that will detect this problem.
<br>&nbsp;
