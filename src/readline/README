This directory is to create GNU readline library and history library.
As some examples (e.g. gdb and octave) shows that readline library is
included in the source release, I did the same. 

To be able to link as dynamic lib, -fPIC is added to the CC flag. This is 
done by patching readline-4.2/Makefile.in with Makefile.in.diff.

While configuring/compiling readline-4.2, I faced a problem that my system
does have 'setlocale' function, while locale.h does not exists. This causes
nls.c compile error. To overcome this problem, I've created the new
autoconf input configure.in.new, and its output configure.new.
The modification is simply check locale.h first, and only check setlocale
when locale.h is found.
