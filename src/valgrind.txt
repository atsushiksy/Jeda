To run valgrind on jeda runtime:

1) Rebuild valgrind with the following instruction from FAQ

Q2. My program dies complaining that syscall 197 is unimplemented.

A2. 197, which is fstat64, is supported by valgrind.  The problem is
    that the /usr/include/asm/unistd.h on the machine on which your
    valgrind was built, doesn't match your kernel -- or, to be more 
    specific, glibc is asking your kernel to do a syscall which is
    not listed in /usr/include/asm/unistd.h.

    The fix is simple.  Somewhere near the top of vg_syscall_mem.c,
    add the following line:

       #define __NR_fstat64            197

    Rebuild and try again.  The above line should appear before any
    uses of the __NR_fstat64 symbol in that file.  If you look at the
    place where __NR_fstat64 is used in vg_syscall_mem.c, it will be
    obvious why this fix works.  NOTE for valgrind versions 1.1.0
    and later, the relevant file is actually coregrind/vg_syscalls.c.


2) Avoid flexlm license call (which cause 191 call error)
   Go to runtime dir, modify Makefile_product with
   
     MY_FLAGS = -DNO_LM_LICENSE
