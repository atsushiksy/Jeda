This directory is to run simulation with ModelSim simulator.

1) Compile all the jeda files and compile verilog with 'vlog'

    do_vlog
    
2) Run simulation with 'random_test'

    run random_test
    
Other test can be ran by 'run <test_name>' as well without recompiling Verilog
image.

See the script 'do_vlog' and 'run' for the detailed information of how to run
it in general.
