The directories under this drectory are:
  verilog:  contains the verilog models. 
            Verilog Models are down loaded from the web above. 
            I created a dummy verilog top "squat_dummy.v" to run jedatemp.
            utopia1_atm_rx.v has a bug fix.
    
  include:  contains jeda include files (.jh)
  
  utils:    contains jeda utilities. e.g. cell class, driver, receiver
  
  suites:   contains jeda top level. It initialize the classes and call a test
  
  tests:    contains various tests. Each tests will be linked to library (.dl)
  
  run:      contains Makefile to compile jeda files, and run_regress script
               to run all the test

The tests:

    manage_if_test.j 
      testing management if and its contents
    cell_in_slide.j  
      testing conflict case in the various input timing
    cell_out_conjest.j
      test the output conflict case to check the flow control mechanism
    slow_tx.j
      test the case that tx side is slow and cell is conjested
    error_cell.j
      inject error cell to check it's correctly dropped
    starvation.j
      create the design problem case that the arbitration per port is not
      fair, and other than port0 won't be serviced
    random_test.j
      configurable random test.

To run simulation:
  cd to run directory and type:
  
    make (must be GNU make)
    run <testname>
    
  where <testname> is the name of the test above without .j
  
    e.g.
    
      make
      run manage_if_test
