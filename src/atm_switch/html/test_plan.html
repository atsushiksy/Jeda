<p><font size=+1>3. Test Plan</font>
<blockquote>It is always good to start your verification work with the
test plan. It shows the fundamental mechanisms for the self-checking testbench
and it will provide a lot of guidance in developing the drivers and other
primitive modules.
<p>I'm not intend to provide a full set of test cases I usually do in my
verification work. Here, I listed a minimal set of test cases. (As the
verilog model is a simple behavioral one,&nbsp; I can't come up with many
corner cases anyway.)
<ul>
<li>
management if test</li>

<br>testing management interface and access to the register contents
<li>
cell input slide test</li>

<br>send multiple cells from different ports in sliding timing window,
testing conflict case in the various input timing
<li>
cell output port congestion test</li>

<br>create the output port congestion situation, testing the output conflict
case to check the flow control mechanism
<li>
slow transmitter speed test</li>

<br>test the case that tx side is slow and cell is congested, testing the
flow control mechanism from tx side.
<li>
error cell test</li>

<br>inject error cell to check it's correctly dropped
<li>
starvation test</li>

<br>create the design problem case that the arbitration per port is not
fair, and other than port0 won't be serviced
<li>
random test</li>

<br>provides the configurable random test sequence</ul>
This list shows that we need the following mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>
ability to drive a cell to a port in various timing, concurrently to multiple
port</li>

<li>
mechanism to create output port conflict situation</li>

<li>
mechanism to control the transmit side speed</li>

<li>
mechanism to inject error cells</li>

<li>
mechanism for random</li>
</ul>
First mechanism is the easy one, as Jeda provide the concurrent programming
primitives. Other mechanisms are implemented in various places in the testbench.
The following chapters will show them.</blockquote>
