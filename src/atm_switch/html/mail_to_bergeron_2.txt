Hi,

It turns that the fix is relatively simple, and I guess the designer
just forgot to implement as the comment above says.
Here's my fix:

      repeat (52) begin
         cell = cell << 8;
         @ (posedge clk);
         i = i + 1;
         cell[8:1] = data;
         
         // During byte #52 (in sequence 1-53)
         // check if there will be room in the buffer.
         // If not, deassert enable during byte 53
         //***AK fix: add i==52 to if condition
         if (i == 52 && cell_bfr[0] !== 1'bx) begin 
            en <= #1 1'b1;
         end
      end

Thanks,
Atsushi
