 We today run jeda on solaris 8,but encountered the same error (Segmentation Fault) as report in linux 7.0.The version of Gcc on solaris is gcc-2.95.It is ok to compile the code,but failed in implementation the file(jvc_mpeg2_env).
 
when the lines from 881 to 929 (in jvc_mpeg2_h.j) are added the error reports,when they are comment and no error reports.for more information see the error.log.
We have attached all files necessary to repro the case.
This puzzles me for several days and please let us know a fix and cause at your convenience.
